# Key Performance Indicators

## KPI

### Code Structure

Each KPI under a strategic objective is indicated by a two-letter code (representing the strategic objective) followed by a number.

:::note Format
```<Strategic Objective Code>``` ```<KPI Number>```
:::

### Examples

- KPIs under the C1 objective: CM1.1, CM1.2...
- KPIs under the F1 objective: FM1.1, FM1.2..

## KPI Components

### Code Structure

Components of a KPI are identified by the KPI code followed by a number.

:::note Format
```<KPI Code>``` . ```<Component Number>```
:::


### Examples

- Components of KPI CM1.1: CM1.1.1, CM1.1.2...
-- Components of KPI FM1.1: FM1.1.1, FM1.1.2...

## Defining KPIs and Setting Weights

- **KPI Definition:** Always define KPIs under each strategic objective. Failing to do so can disconnect the link
between objectives and KPIs, affecting the overall strategy execution.
- **Weight Assignment:**  Assign appropriate weights to each KPI to reflect their relative importance. This helps in
accurately measuring performance against strategic objectives.

## KPI Formula

- **Formula Accuracy:** Ensure each KPI formula is set properly using the designated KPI components. Incorrect formulas can lead to misleading performance data. Component Integration: Verify that each component is correctly integrated into the KPI formula. This is crucial for the precise calculation of KPI values. Impact on Performance Calculation: Adherence to this coding pattern and proper KPI setup are essential. Any deviation or error can adversely affect the accuracy of performance calculations and the alignment of strategic objectives. Consistently using the correct coding and settings is vital for reliable data analysis and effective performance measurement.
