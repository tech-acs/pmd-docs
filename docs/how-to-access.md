The home page of the dashboard presents a list of applications, each aligned with the user’s assigned permissions.

1. Users with the `Dashboard Users` role, for example, have access limited to functions like `View Dashboard` and `Printable Reports`.

2. Those assigned the `Data Manager` role will find options primarily focused on data entry.

3. Users in the `Data Approver` role will find options focusing on validation and approval submitted by data managers.  

4. Users assigned the `Data Approver` role will find options specifically centred on validating and approving  data submitted by `Data Managers`.

5. Users in the `Dashboard Manager` and `System Manager` role have the privilege to view all available options.

This structured segmentation is intentionally designed to guide users to the specific functions relevant to their role, ensuring efficient use of the system while minimizing unnecessary exposure to its broader functionalities.
