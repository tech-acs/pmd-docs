# Configuring Dashboard Variables

Setting up the dashboard for use requires several configurations, which include:

1. **Data Collection Frequency:** This refers to how often KPI data is expected to be collected from sources.
2. **Data Sources:** These are the various origins from which the data is sourced.
3. **Period Type:** This denotes the specific performance period for which the dashboard is set.
4. **Performance Period:** The time frame during which the dashboard operates and monitors data.
5. **Organizational Units (Org Units):** These are the specific segments or departments within the organization
relevant to the data.
6. **Data Status:** This indicates the current stage or condition of the data within the dashboard.
7. **Unit of Measure:** The standard unit in which the KPIs are measured.

Each of these elements plays a crucial role in the effective functioning and accuracy of the dashboard
