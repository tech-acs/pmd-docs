# System Managers

The System Manager plays a vital role in ensuring the seamless functioning and high performance of the dashboard system. This role is essential both before and after deployment. 

Pre-deployment responsibilities involve setting up the infrastructure, including the installation and configuration of front-end, back-end (API) applications, and database management

Post-deployment, the role shifts to ongoing maintenance, which is critical during operational phases. This includes data backup, restoration, and consistent performance monitoring. In essence, the System Manager is fundamental in supporting the Dashboard Manager and guaranteeing that the system operates smoothly, efficiently, and reliably at all times.

## Deployment

During deployment, the System Manager undertakes several critical tasks:

1. Preparing Infrastructure: Setting up the required infrastructure based on the application needs.
2. Front-end Application Deployment and Maintenance:
   - Installing and configuring the front-end application on the server.
   - Monitoring its performance and resolving any issues.
   - Back-end Application Deployment and Maintenance:
3. Installing and configuring the back-end (API) application.
4. Overseeing its performance and troubleshooting problems.
5. Ensuring the security of the back-end application.
6. Database Deployment and Maintenance:
7. Installing and configuring the PostgreSQL database.
    - Monitoring database performance and addressing any concerns
    - Securing the database to protect data integrity.

## Maintenance

Once deployed, the System Manager is essential in maintaining the dashboardâ€™s health and performance. Their responsibilities include:

- **Performance Monitoring:** Regularly checking system performance, identifying any bottlenecks, and implementing solutions to enhance functionality.
- **Security Management:** Enforcing security policies, configuring firewalls and intrusion detection systems, auditing access logs, and staying updated on potential threats.
- **Documentation and Maintenance:** Keeping detailed records of system configurations, updates, and creating robust backup and disaster recovery plans.
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** Working with other team members to swiftly resolve any issues related to the application and server.
